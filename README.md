# Robot Storytelling (Code Excerpt)

Complementary code of the thesis on "*Computational Storytelling as Embodied Robot Performance with Gesture and Spatial Metaphor*". 

The provided code represents most of the functionalities and algorithms used to create the different robotic performances. The code is redacted in order to hide passwords, access credentials for third party APIs and access to the Nao robots. The `consciousness.py` class holds the most important modules to access Nao functionalities. Several knowledge bases are stored separately in the OSF repository as noted in the thesis.
