1
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,722
Say hello to Miss Jane Marple

2
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,188
and let us welcome Reginald Jeeves

3
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,341
What if Miss Jane Marple fell in love with
Reginald Jeeves?

4
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,802
Miss Jane Marple and Reginald Jeeves had not
met since they were young children.

5
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:38,912
you are as beautiful as a picture

6
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:40,883
Why thank you

7
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:43,980
So at first, Jane fell deeper in love with
Reginald than she ever had with Agatha Christie.

8
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:50,923
But Bertie Wooster used blackmail to manipulate
Jane

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,956
your friend needs to be silenced, Reginald.

10
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,988
could you spot me some cash?

11
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,371
I think I can do that

12
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:07,026
So Jane borrowed a lot of money from Reginald.

13
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,929
But Reginald had every reason to distrust
Jane

14
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,648
I don't quite trust you yet

15
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:28,725
we must learn to trust each other.

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,631
I don't have a good opinion of you

17
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,592
how dare you judge me

18
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:37,268
So Reginald judged Jane and found her wanting.

19
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:42,448
you are a villain through and through

20
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,664
do you have any evidence to back that up?

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,899
Well, Reginald accused Jane of heinous wrongdoing.

22
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,563
frankly I'm insulted

23
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,668
it wasn't my intention to offend

24
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:10,906
Then Reginald offended Jane's sensibilities.

25
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:16,353
I'm not paying you another penny

26
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:19,414
don't make me call in the heavy mob

27
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,708
So Jane left Reginald hanging for what was
owed it.

28
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,491
my lawyers will hear of this

29
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,638
aren't you taking this too far?

30
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,542
Well, Reginald sued Jane for damages inflicted
when solving crimes.

31
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,581
let's put our differences behind us

32
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,614
I'm sure we can agree a settlement

33
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,791
So Jane buried the hatchet with Reginald.

34
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,290
But Jane resented Reginald for being manipulative,
controlling and pious

35
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,105
I deserve much better than this

36
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,785
what are you grumbling about now?

37
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,761
It's not me it's you

38
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:19,508
so you're moving on without me?

39
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,415
So Jane did not let Reginald down gently.

40
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:25,375
Then Hercule Poirot kidnapped Jane and kept
her hostage

41
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:32,577
don't just stand there. Call the police, Reginald.

42
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:36,186
So Reginald followed the crumbs and tracked
Hercule down

43
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,425
I knew you could do it, Reginald.

44
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,890
But Hercule crucially underestimated Reginald

45
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:50,550
I think you may have the upper hand, Reginald.

46
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,548
So Reginald lured Hercule out of hiding

47
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,615
soon I will spring my trap, Jane.

48
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,987
Then Reginald murdered Hercule in his bed

49
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:07,766
I would call that justifiable homicide, Reginald.

50
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:10,627
save me. Save me

51
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:22,294
I got to you in the nick of time

52
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:25,008
After this, Reginald saved Jane's life.

53
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:29,364
thank you for everything

54
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,094
you're welcome

55
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:33,882
So Jane thanked Reginald effusively.

56
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:46,496
I think we should get married

57
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:55,816
yes let's get married

58
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:57,413
Then Jane married Reginald in Kent and they
honeymooned in Mayfair.

59
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,133
But Jane argued with Reginald over the best
way of rescuing aristocrats

60
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,117
you are so wrong

61
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,380
you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.

62
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,054
is that a glazed look in your eye?

63
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:27,731
talking with you is about as thrilling as
wallpaper

64
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:30,841
So Jane bored Reginald to death.

65
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,222
why the cold shoulder?

66
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,871
you are in my bad books

67
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,750
Well, Jane was in the dog-house as far as
Reginald was concerned.

68
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,257
I won't be home for dinner tonight

69
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:48,909
I trust you implicitly

70
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,518
So Reginald fooled around and cheated on Jane.

71
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,921
you are about as frightening as a wet kitten

72
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:16,368
do not talk like that to me

73
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,294
Well, Jane called an end to Reginald's abuse.

74
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:23,210
But Reginald abused and degraded Jane

75
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,607
I don't deserve this abuse

76
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,801
stop over-reacting you snowflake.

77
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:46,160
I'm putting you on report

78
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,730
report me all you want

79
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,534
So Jane reported Reginald to the police.

80
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:04,998
was that a threat?

81
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:08,224
I don't make threats just promises

82
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,615
Well, Reginald threatened Jane with talk of
petrifying her with his earnest stare.

83
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,170
catch me if you can

84
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,367
you can't hide foreverr

85
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,878
So Jane hid from Reginald in the darkest corner
of Kent.

86
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:34,298
But Reginald found Jane in a drawing room,
solving crimes

87
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,085
well you've caught up to me

88
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:52,351
I knew I'd find you eventually.

89
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,056
do you swear your allegience to me?

90
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:59,887
I will be your most humble servant

91
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,056
Then Jane bowed down to Reginald as the undisputed
king of rescuing aristocrats.

92
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:09,077
I bought you. I own you

93
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:12,484
slavery is no longer legal

94
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:15,023
But in the end Reginald turned Jane into an
indentured slave.

95
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,582
Thereafter Jane would dance to Reginald's
tune and jump at Reginald's orders.


96
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:25,083
Let's say goodbye to Miss Jane Marple

97
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,398
and let us thank Reginald Jeeves
